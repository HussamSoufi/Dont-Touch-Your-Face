## How to Run:
when you run the python script the camera will take a photo
you need to choose two boxes (face & hand) that you don't want to collapse!
Then press Enter to start tracking and ESC to Exit
p.s: choose your face at first and then your hand for better results!
Have fun and stay healthy. Cheers! - Sam
